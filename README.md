# Adding-features-to-our-bouncing-balls-demo-MDN

My version of MDN's Assessment: Adding features to our bouncing balls demo

The objective of this assignment is to "to test comprehension of JavaScript objects and object-oriented constructs". This is tested by having the user add additional features to MDN's bouncy ball demo/example such as "by adding a user-controlled evil circle, which will eat the balls if it catches them".
